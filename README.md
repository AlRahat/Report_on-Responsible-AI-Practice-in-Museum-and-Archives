üìò Abstract

Purpose ‚Äì This research explores the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in museums and archives, focusing on how AI can improve the preservation of cultural heritage, increase accessibility, and engage visitors while managing ethical risks.  

Design/Method/Approach ‚Äì A narrative review was conducted, analyzing recent studies, ethical frameworks, and case examples from museums, archives, and related cultural institutions to understand AI applications and governance.  

Findings ‚Äì AI offers benefits such as automating metadata extraction, enabling virtual tours, and supporting personalized visitor experiences. However, challenges remain, including bias in algorithms, lack of transparency, privacy issues, and risks of cultural misrepresentation. The study emphasizes the need for clear ethical guidelines, community involvement, and transparency. Smaller institutions face hurdles due to limited resources, highlighting the need for scalable governance and partnerships.  

Implications ‚Äì The findings provide practical guidance for cultural institutions aiming to adopt responsible AI practices that balance innovation with ethics and cultural sensitivity.  

Originality/Value ‚Äì This paper uniquely adapts AI governance frameworks to museums and archives, addressing their specific ethical and operational challenges and helping shape responsible AI use in cultural heritage.  

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Responsible AI, Museums, Archives, Ethical Governance, Cultural Heritage, Community Engagement, Social Justice
